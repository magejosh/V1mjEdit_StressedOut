# Stressed Out Mod - By IrishManJMo
magejosh updated to v1 with permission from [IrishManJMo](https://github.com/IrishManJMo)
Made best efforts to maintain the intent of the mod while doing the updates. Though some changes were necessary due to vanilla changes. 

## Requirements
Should be server-side safe and require only the host to install it, whether that is a server or the player hosting the multiplayer game.

### Changelog: 
*StressedOut v1.0.3.0*

- changed zombie hand items application method to improve compatibility with other mods
- changed name keys with spaces and those without to uniformly follow more closely the vanilla naming conversation.
- changed loot from the older loot containers append methods to the newer loot groups method to better balance the new items with the existing loot pools.
- added foodRawMeat conversion recipes 
- added further meat type harvest conversion to the missing and new animal entityclass harvests drops.
- added vanilla recipes using the new meats
- added perkLivingOffTheLand compatibility to the new crop blocks harvests.
- adjusted buff trigger hook for compatibility best practices 
- Adjusted localization and added descriptions where they were missing.
- adjusted progression to integrate the food cooking with the new crafting food perk, removed the deprecated perkMasterChef alterations. Added new learn by looting methods to perkBrewMaster so each level in it helps you find food and medical supplies and crafting magazines.
- added vanilla tags to the new items so they will be found in food and medical loot tables based on perks like the new vanilla loot by perk method.


## Roadmap
magejosh: IrishManJMo mentioned wanting to make a version with adjustable settings to disable the visual effects from some of the buffs for players with visual issues. I have a method to do so with xml only, and will make that next. But I'd also like to make a version that uses gears for an ingame menu option to disable them. Working on learning the way to use it best and will share that when I get it working.
I'd also like to add new icons and models as an addon mod that loads after this one and makes all the new things prettier. That will come sometime soon, but might be a month or two.
Other things on my wishlist of additions:
- Hangover cure, and make painkillers speedup recovery time from a hangover.
- Bong items, Dabs items. Custom handheld models for each. Same for the foods.
- Custom POIs. Like a dispensary, a commercial grow operation, an underground black market grow op, drug dealer's house, a diner with some canned honey ham blocks, a coffe shop for stoners maybe as a multipart poi with a dispensary and donut shop or something. Would be cool to get some custom blocks to go with these as well.
- Wild versions of the new crops, and add them to biome spawning. Agave and Sugar cane in the desert. Wheat in the forest. Barley in the burnt forest. Cocoa in the snow. Tobacco, Sativa, and Indica in the wasteland.
- NPCs that might trade things for joints and liquors. NPC traders for the dispensary POIs.
- Compatibility patch mod to integrate this one with telric's fishing and telric's sleep mods as well as khzmusic's Food Spoilage mod.
